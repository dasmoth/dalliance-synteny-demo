Simple testbed for synteny browsing using Dalliance.

There are two basically-unmodified Dalliance instances, plus an extra component
to show the alignment blocks between them.  Click on the alignment panel to synchronize
the views.

Warning: first load takes a while (circa 10 seconds).  Needs a few changes in Dalliance's
chainset code to fix this.
