Simple testbed for synteny browsing using Dalliance.

There are two basically-unmodified Dalliance instances, plus an extra component
to show the alignment blocks between them.  Click on the alignment panel to synchronize
the views.

Thanks to those at BOSC Codefest 2014, and especially Nathan Weeks for the initial idea.
